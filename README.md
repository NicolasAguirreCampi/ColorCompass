### Overview

ColorCompass is a Python library designed to efficiently find the  named color to a given RGB value by using an efficient Euclidean distance calculation across a range of predefined colors.

### How it Works

#### The Euclidean Distance Calculation

The crux of ColorCompass lies in utilizing the Euclidean Distance formula to find the  matching color name for a given RGB input. Given an RGB value, the Euclidean Distance between two points (color values, in our context) in a three-dimensional space (R, G, B) is calculated as:

Distance = ‚àö(R_2 - R_1)^2 + (G_2 - G_1)^2 + (B_2 - B_1)^2

Here,
- (R_1, G_1, B_1) and (R_2, G_2, B_2) are the RGB values of the two colors being compared.
- The formula basically measures the straight-line distance between two points in a 3D space (your two colors, in the RGB color space).

#### The Algorithmic Approach

1. **Input Color Value**: A user inputs an RGB color value that they'd like to map to a named color.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**: For the input color, ColorCompass calculates the Euclidean Distance between the input RGB value and all stored RGB values in the library's color database, effectively identifying which stored color is (has the minimal Euclidean Distance) to the provided input.
   
3. **Return  Color**: The algorithm identifies the color name associated with the RGB value in the database that has the smallest Euclidean Distance to the input color. This color name is returned to the user as the closest match.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install ColorCompass using pip:

```sh
pip install colorcompass
```

## üé® Basic Usage

To find the color name for a given RGB value, simply use the `get_color_name` function as follows:

```python
from colorcompass import get_color_name

# Define your target color as an RGB list or a hexadecimal string
target_color_rgb = [152, 251, 152]
target_color_hex = "#98FB98"

# Use the function to find the color name
color_name_rgb = get_color_name(target_color_rgb)
color_name_hex = get_color_name(target_color_hex)

# Print the found color name
print(f"Color to RGB{tuple(target_color_rgb)}: {color_name_rgb}")
print(f"Color to {target_color_hex}: {color_name_hex}")
```
